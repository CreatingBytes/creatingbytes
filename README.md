### Hi there ✌️

I'm Andre, an apprenticeship trainee based in Germany.

I mostly work on personal projects where I can continuously improve my skills.  
For UI inspiration, I use AI tools to explore and discover inspiring designs.

On this account, I primarily push private projects and will add public projects in the future.
